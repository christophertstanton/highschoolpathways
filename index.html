              roles on LinkedIn, and the platform’s “Alumni” and “People”
              search features help you see real paths taken by people in jobs

              <strong>WayUp</strong> focuses on internships and early-career
              jobs, especially for college students and recent grads, and helps
              candidates get discovered through profile-based matching.

            <p>
              Other internship platforms (such as InternJobs or
              InternshipFinder) aggregate thousands of listings and often
              include guides on writing résumés, preparing for interviews, and
              converting internships into full-time offers.

              Historically, <strong>Internships.com</strong> was a major
              internship search site; today, its role is largely filled by

              American Job Centers (AJCs) provide “one-stop” local access to
              career counseling, job listings, résumé and interview workshops,

              AJCs can also connect you to apprenticeship opportunities,

              School counselors can help you interpret assessment results,
